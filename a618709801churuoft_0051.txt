it would be seen, es recently contended by Me. Birrell
and Mr. ὖ. H. Round, “ that it is the sacrifice of the
Mass that matters.” Tnat was e point that appe-led
not only to the learned few, but to every ‹levout
Christzan soul. 'rhet was tho root end the very heare

real explanation why the Bishop of Seliabury, who a.

He would now endeavour to clear up the ambiguity
he began by referring to. lt tna contentiori of the
Anglican Archbishops meant anything it meant that the

Orders of the Roman and flasi-‚ern Churches, or, aa the
late Archbisnop of Canterbury said, ⁴· they are in
origin, continuity, matter, form, intention, and all that
belongs to them idemical with those of the Church ot*
Rome.” It was evident, therefore, tuat. the Arcbbis'uops
intended to claim for the Anglican priesthood all the

owers claimed by the priesthood of the Basteru and

they reelly claim those powers? Did they claim the power

their own showing, the Angliean priesthood was as
different from the Roman and Greek priesthood as their
